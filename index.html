        <h2>My favorite Artists</h2>
        <h3>Kanye West</h3>
        <p class="kanye">In my opinion, Kanye is the best musical artist of our generation. Every single album that Kanye puts out sounds different from his last, but none of them sacrafice quality for innovation. His albums 808s and Heartbreaks and The College Dropout are two of the most influential albums of all time, paving the way for many new artists such as Drake, Kid Cudi, and Travis Scott. </p>

        <h4>Michael Jackson</h4>
        <p class="MJ">Michael Jackson is one of the most talented people to ever live. His music still remains timeless and his vocal abilites were imperssive even from a very young age. His album Thriller is a classic and his music is perfect for any mood.</p>

        <h5 class="ocean">Frank Ocean</h5>
        <p class="frank">Frank Ocean is my favorite RNB artist. His soothing voice paired with amazing production makes for 
            some of the best sad songs I've ever heard. His second album, "Blonde" is one of the best things I've ever heard
            and especially hits at night.
