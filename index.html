        <h2>My favorite Artists</h2>
        <h3>Kanye West</h3>
        <p class="kanye">In my opinion, Kanye is the best musical artist of our generation. Every single album that Kanye puts out sounds different from his last, but none of them sacrafice quality for innovation. His albums 808s and Heartbreaks and The College Dropout are two of the most influential albums of all time, paving the way for many new artists such as Drake, Kid Cudi, and Travis Scott. </p>

        <h4>Michael Jackson</h4>
        <p class="MJ">Michael Jackson is one of the most talented people to ever live. His music still remains timeless and his vocal abilites were imperssive even from a very young age. His album Thriller is a classic and his music is perfect for any mood.</p>

    <div class="">
        <h5 class="ocean">Frank Ocean</h5>
        <p class="frank">Frank Ocean is my favorite RNB artist. His soothing voice paired with amazing production makes for 
            some of the best sad songs I've ever heard. His second album, "Blonde" is one of the best things I've ever heard
            and especially hits at night.

    <h5>My Favorite Albums</h5>
    <div><h6>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</h6>
        <p class="mbdtf">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is Kanye's magnum opus. In order to create this album, he flew out some of the best musical talents in the world out to a studio in Hawaii to work on crafting the best music possible. The end result is an album with some of the best production and rapping ever made. According to Kanye, the song, "Power" took 5,000 hours to make. </p>

    <div> 
        <p class="thriller">Thriller</p>
        <p class="mjthriller">This album speaks for itself. There are so many hits on this such as Billie Jean and Beat It. The album is still frequently played today and it singlehandedly defined the sound of its decade. </p>

        <p class="kdot">good kid, m.A.A.d city</p>
        <p class="kendrick">Kendrick Lamar's best album, good kid, m.A.A.d city is my favorite storytelling album. Kendrick does such a good job at emmersing the listener inside of his world with great lyricism and production. Every song expands upon the story creating for a great listening experience front to back.  </p>
